# Things to remember

AVE:
- Batchnorm 
- maxpool or stride
- LeakyReLU
- Upsample or convtranspose2d

# ToDo:
- Save models in a proper way
- Test model after each epoch on test set 
- Visualize examples
-- Plot original and reconstructed
-- Check tensor permutation
- Loss plotten
- Sample examples

Overleaf: 
- increase spacing around equations
